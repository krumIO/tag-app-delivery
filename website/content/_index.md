## Introduction

Inspired by the cross-functional cooperation promised by DevOps, platform 
engineering has begun to emerge in enterprises as an explicit form of that 
cooperation. Platforms curate and present foundational capabilities, frameworks 
and experiences to facilitate and accelerate the work of internal customers such 
as application developers, data scientists and information workers. Particularly 
in the field of cloud computing, platforms have helped enterprises realize 
values long promised by cloud like fast product releases, portability across 
infrastructures, more secure and resilient products, and greater developer 
productivity.

This paper intends to support enterprise leaders, enterprise architects and 
platform team leaders to advocate for, investigate and plan internal platforms 
for cloud computing.  We believe platforms significantly impact enterprises' 
actual value streams, but only indirectly, so leadership consensus and support 
is vital to the long-term sustainability and success of platform teams. In this 
paper we'll enable that support by discussing what the value of platforms is, how 
to measure it, and how to implement platform teams that maximize it.
