Platforms and platform engineering are a popular topic in today's cloud computing world. 
Before diving into definitions, techniques, and measurements for platform building, it 
is important to first explore the value platforms provide that's driving this 
well-deserved attention.

Process improvements over the past 2-3 decades have significantly increased the 
agility of software application and product teams, offering them flexible services 
for both infrastructure like compute, network and storage as well as developer 
services like builds, tests, delivery and observability. This autonomy and process 
improvement has also had the effect of gradually shifting more and more responsibility 
for supporting services to product teams, forcing them to spend more and more time 
and cognitive energy on infrastructure concerns and reducing their time to produce 
value relevant to their organization.

The desire to refocus delivery teams on their core focus and reduce duplication of
effort across the organisation has motivated enterprises to implement and platforms for 
cloud-native computing. By investing in platforms, enterprises can:

1. Reduce the cognitive load on product teams and thereby accelerate product 
   development and delivery
1. Improve reliability and resiliency of products relying on platform 
   capabilities by dedicating experts to configure and manage them
1. Accelerate product development and delivery by reusing and sharing platform 
   tools and knowledge across many teams in an enterprise
1. Reduce risk of security, regulatory and functional issues in products and 
   services by governing platform capabilities and the users, tools and processes 
   surrounding them
1. Enable cost-effective and productive use of services from public clouds 
   and other managed offerings by enabling delegation of implementations to those 
   providers while maintaining control over user experience

These benefits accrue in part because just a few platform teams serve many 
product teams, multiplying their impact; in part because platform teams 
consolidate management of common functionality, facilitating governance; and in 
part because platform teams emphasize user interfaces and experiences above all 
else.

A team of platform experts not only reduces common work \[1\] demanded of 
product teams but also optimizes platform capabilities \[2\] used in those 
products. A platform team also maintains a set of conventional patterns, 
knowledge and tools used broadly across the enterprise \[3\]; enabling 
developers to quickly contribute to other teams and products built on the same 
foundations. The shared platform patterns also allow embedding governance and 
controls \[4\] in templates, patterns and capabilities. Finally, because 
platform teams corral providers and provide consistent experiences over their 
offerings, they enable efficient use of public clouds and service providers 
\[5\] for foundational but undifferentiated capabilities such as databases, 
identity access, infrastructure operations, and app lifecycle.
