## About CNCF TAG App Delivery

### **Introduction**

The charter describes the operations of the CNCF TAG Application Delivery. The Application Delivery TAG focuses on delivering cloud native applications which involves multiple phases including building, deploying, managing, and operating. Additionally, the TAG produces supporting material and best practices for end-users, and provide guidance and coordination for CNCF projects working within the TAG’s scope.

### **Mission**

Consistent with the [CNCF TAG definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md), the mission of CNCF TAG App Delivery is:

* To collaborate on areas related to developing, distributing, deploying, managing and operating secure cloud-native applications with the target of delivering application in manner of cloud native.
* To develop informational resources including guides, tutorials and white papers to give the community an understanding of best practices, trade-offs, and value-adds regarding to application delivery.
* To identify suitable projects and gaps in the landscape, periodically updating the TOC with suggested actions in a structured manner. This includes helping the TOC with assessments and due diligence of prospective new projects.

### **Areas considered in Scope**

TAG Application Delivery focuses on the following topics of the lifecycle of cloud-native applications:

* Application definition, including description, parameter and configuration
* Guidance and practice for application design and development
* Application bundling and deployment
* Package management
* Application delivery workflow and strategy
* Configuration source driven workflow
* Release management

The TAG will work on developing best practices, fostering collaboration between related projects, working on improving tool interoperability as well as proposing new initiatives and projects when blank spots in the current landscape are identified. 

For CNCF projects, the scope of application delivery TAG engages, amongst others, with the application management focused ones, for example:

* Brigade
* Buildpacks
* CloudEvents
* Flux
* Helm
* Kubernetes

The following, non exhaustive, sample list of activities and deliverables are in-scope for the TAG:

* Education material to help provide guidance for the community
    * Summary and overview of projects available in the community
    * Definitions of implementations and patterns for best practices for delivering cloud native applications at enterprise scale
    * Tooling composition and tool chain creation based on existing projects. 
    * Best practices for development, operations and monitoring workflows
* Application definition, development and distribution
    * Application descriptor
    * Artifacts (e.g. bundles, packaging, images), package management and repositories
    * Configuration customization (e.g. templating and parameter)
* Guidance for application development and architecture
    * Reference design of microservices, decomposing monoliths
    * Reference design of event-based architectures
* Standard and generic application delivery pattern
    * Typical rollout strategy implementations with reference architectures
    * Best practices of configuration source driven workflow for application delivery
    * Best practices of standard application delivery pipeline
* Other tools or practices which may be involved in the workflow of application delivery, including but not limited to:
    * Building and configuration
    * Deploying, Orchestration and Patching
    * Policy and security
    * Debugging and monitoring
    * Hosting environments and interoperability (e.g. PaaS, FaaS, CaaS,...)
    * CI/CD
* Serverless - Serverless applications are a core part of cloud-native application development and the Serverless WG will migrate to live under this TAG.

### **Areas considered out of Scope**

Anything not explicitly considered in the scope above. Example include:

* Testing.
* Non cloud-native applications. 
* Developer tools which are not closely related to delivering application to cloud.
* Specific programming model or developing framework.
* Definition of standards for components like container images and other infrastructure-level building blocks of cloud-native applications.
