While platforms promise lots of value, they also bring challenges like the
following which implementers should keep in mind.

1. Platform teams must treat their platforms like products and develop them
   together with users
1. Platform teams must carefully choose their priorities and initial partner
   application teams
1. Platform teams must seek support of enterprise leadership and show impact on
   value streams

Perhaps most important is to treat the platform as a customer-facing product and
recognize that its success is directly dependent on the success of its users and
products; and as such it's vital that platform teams partner with app teams and
other users to prioritize, plan, implement and iterate on the platform's
capabilities and user experiences. Platform teams that release features and
experiences without feedback or that rely on top-down mandates to achieve adoption
are almost certain to find resistance and resentment from their users and miss a
lot of the promised value. To counter this, platform teams should include product
managers from the start to share roadmaps, gather feedback and generally understand
and represent the needs of platform users.

When adopting platforms, choosing the right capabilities and experiences to
enable first, can be crucial. Capabilities that are frequently required and
undifferentiated, like pipelines, databases and observability, may be a good
place to start. Platform teams may also choose to focus first on a limited number
of engaged and skillful app teams. Detailed feedback from such teams improves the
first platform experiences; and people from those teams help champion and
evangelize the platform to later adopters.

Finally, it's vital in large enterprises to quickly gain leadership support for
platform teams. Many enterprise leaders perceive IT infrastructure as an expense
quite disconnected from their primary value streams and may try to constrain
costs and resources allocated to IT platforms, leading to a poor implementation,
unrealized promises and frustration. To mitigate this, platform teams need to
demonstrate their direct impact on and relationships with product and value
stream teams (see the previous two paragraphs), presenting the platform team as
a strategic partner of product teams in delivering value to customers.
