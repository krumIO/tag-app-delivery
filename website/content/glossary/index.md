A **platform** aggregates capabilities to serve developers and operators in
development and delivery of products, services and apps. In reference to the
scenarios it aims to support, a platform may be named a "Developer Platform", a
"Delivery Platform", an "App Platform" or even a "Cloud Platform." The
connotations of the older term "Platform-as-a-Service", or PaaS, are also
influential.

**Platforms** enable developers and operators to deliver applications and
services faster by providing and managing common capabilities. Platforms bridge
between platform users and platform capability providers.

**Platform users** include but aren't limited to app developers and operators, data
scientists, COTS software operators, and information workers - whoever runs
software on the platform or uses platform provided capabilities.

**Platform capability providers** implement infrastructure services, often as
controllers and operators.

**Platform developers** design interfaces and tools to enable provisioning and
integration of platform capabilities in applications.

**Platform product managers** are responsible for understanding the experience of
platform users and building a roadmap that addresses platform product gaps and
opportunities.
